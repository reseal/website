Welcome to my place on the web 👋

I am a final year PhD student at University of Bath, working on reinforcement learning and supervised by [Professor Özgür Şimşek](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z1BYZG0AAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis is looking at skill discovery for permutation puzzles such as Rubik's cube. This is an interesting topic because humans provide a clear example of hierarchical behaviour in how they solve these puzzles, yet up until now there are no RL methods that take a similar approach!

I have gained a range of skills throughout my PhD, particularly in programming, communicating ideas, and critical thinking. I spent a while researching offline RL, in particular looking at adaptive conservatism using uncertainty estimation. I'm excited by the potential offline RL has for opening up more real-world applications of decision-making AI (in fields such as medicine, education, finance, and robotics). Early in my PhD I worked on generative models for computer vision. Although I switched away from this area, it was valuable experience and allowed me to develop my knowledge of and ability to use deep learning.

In summer 2022 I interned at Expedia Group, working in the Revenue Optimisation and Data Science team. I had an amazing time there and worked on a very interesting project which involved developing a gradient boosting model for dynamic pricing. My experience confirmed to me that I'm an applied scientist at heart and like to be in an environment where ideas are iterated on fast.

Outside of work I'm very into fitness and sports. I've been a big gym-goer for years but now balance that with a fair bit of running and swimming. I also love surfing, tennis, and climbing. When I'm not being active I enjoy reading books and meditating. Poker is a long time hobby of mine; I've played upwards of 2 million hands over the last 15 years, and have been moderately profitable at it.
